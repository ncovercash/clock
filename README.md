# Clock

Simple clock page initially used as a Chrome floating app made years ago, now it still exists purely for educational purposes.  Quick, dirty, but does the job ~~using way too much jQuery~~.

Recommended to use about a 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio, no fancy cropping or intelligent sizing is really done besides overall width.  It will take a second or two to resize the clock after the window is resized.
